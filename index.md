# Who am I?

Hi there! I am Kai Yan (颜开 in Chinese), a fourth-year Ph.D. student in the Department of Computer Science at University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC), co-advised by <a href="https://alexander-schwing.de/" title="Prof. Alex G. Schwing">Prof. Alexander Schwing</a> and <a href="https://yxw.web.illinois.edu/" title="Prof. Yu-Xiong Wang">Prof. Yu-Xiong Wang</a>. 
Prior to that, I get my Bachelor of Science degree in computer science at Peking University with a *Summa Cum Laude* and a national scholarship. In my high school years, I learned informatics and got a silver award in the National Olympiad of Informatics (NOI 2016).

My research interest is **deep learning for better decision making**, which is mainly **deep reinforcement learning and imitation learning**. I have conducted research in the following fields: 1) optimization with prediction, 
2) multi-agent reinforcement learning, 3) demonstration-guided reinforcement learning and imitation learning, 4) decision transformer, and 5) Large Language Model (LLM)+MCTS.

# Teaching Experiences

I was a teaching assistant for **Computational Photography (Spring 2024)** at UIUC, during which I held office hours, graded homework and designed exam questions. Prior to that, I was a teaching assistant for **Introduction to Computer Systems (Fall 2019)** at Peking University, where I led a seminar of 15 people every week, revising and expaning lessons taught in class, grading homeworks, and teaching how to write lecture notes.

# Other Experiences

I served for the department of outreach in the EECS Student Union of Peking University in 2017-2018, and as the vice president of the EECS Student Union in the academic year of 2018-2019. We have organized awesome events with hundreds of participants, such as Hackathon and Freshmen Ball.
